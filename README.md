Based on [code by u/bass-blowfish](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/nmbq55/version_2_more_user_friendly_login_screen/), this simple CSS aims to make the login screen for worlds in [Foundry VTT](https://www.foundryvtt.com/) a little bit prettier by tidying up the interface and including custom logos. It is compatible with FoundryVTT version 0.8.X, v9 and v10.

To install, add the CSS to the `style.css` file in the `/resources/app/public/css` folder of your Foundry installation. The code includes instructions on how to insert your images and adjust certain variables like button colour.

## Notice
This module is technically considered as "Core Translation Moudule", which means **you can't use this module if you are using another core translation module**.

Foundry's language file falls back to default language (English) if your json file doesn't contain appropriate keys. 

Therefore, the screen will be shown as English, with world's login screen css applied.

A user can only use one core translation module at a time. 

If you are already using other core translation module, you should manually add css file to your module.
